https://leetcode.com/problems/mirror-reflection/discuss/2376298/What-If-the-Ray-Not-Reflected-and-Expand-the-Room-or-Image-Explanation

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) [858. Mirror Reflection](https://leetcode.com/problems/mirror-reflection/).

What if we assume the Ray **Not Reflected and Keeps Going**?

Consider that there is a mirrored world behind the mirror, we can expand the room behind the mirror. The ray has not been reflected and keep going cross the room.

As the image below shows, we can easily know which receptor will the ray will meet first.

```java
class Solution {
    public int mirrorReflection(int p, int q) {
        if (p == q) {
            return 1;
        }

        if (q == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int lcm = p * q / gcd(p, q);
        int x = lcm / p;
        int y = lcm / q;

        if (x % 2 == 1 && y % 2 == 1) {
            return 1;
        } else if (x % 2 == 0 && y % 2 == 1) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            return 2;
        }
    }

    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}
```
