[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) [69. Sqrt(x)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx).

***By Frank Luo***

Given an integer `N` and a tolerance level `L`, the task is to find the square root of that number.

The **Newton's Method** is:

Let `N` be any number then the square root of `N` can be given by the formula: 
`root = 0.5 * (X + (N / X))` where `X` is any guess which can be assumed to be `N` or `1`. 

1. In the above formula, `X` is any assumed square root of `N` and root is the correct square root of `N`.
2. **Tolerance limit** is the maximum difference between `X` and root allowed.

But how to understand this method?

# Newton’s Method

If we want to find the **square root** of the integer `N`. Obviously, the square root of `N` is the function `y = f(x) = x^2 - N` of zero.

![Newton Iteration Method](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/fa60c623-19d9-4c11-9265-6caf7d713124_1647778616.7749531.png)

We take any `x_n` as an initial value, at each iteration of the step. We find the point `(x_n, f(x_n))` on the image of the function, make a slope through this point, the derivative of this point `f'(x_n)`, the intersection with the horizontal axis is denoted as `x_{n+1}` compared to `x_n`. It's closer to zero. 

The equation of the straight line is:

`2 * x_n = (x_n^2 - N) / (x_n - x)`

The intersection with the horizontal axis is the equation:

`2 * x_n * x - (x_n^2 + N) = 0`

which is the new iteration result `x_{n+1}`:

`x_{n+1} = 0.5 * (x_n + N / x_n)`

After iterations, the value of the true zero point sqrt(N) is close enough to be an answer.

There comes two questions:
1. Which initial value do we assign?
2. When does the iteration end?

### Initial value

As mentioned **rule 1**, we assign `X` to the `N` itself because we want to find the  positive `sqrt(N)` and `N` is surely larger than `sqrt(N)`.

### Ending iteration 

After each iteration, the answer is closer to the zero point. So when the intersection obtained from two adjacent iterations is very close, we can conclude that the result at this time is enough for us to get the answer. 

As mentioned **rule 2**, if the calculated root comes inside the tolerance allowed then break out of the loop. 

In general, it can be judged whether the difference between the results of two adjacent iterations is less than a very small non-negative number.

## Code

```java
    public static int mySqrt_newton(int x) {
        if (x == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        double N = x;
        double x0 = x;
        while (true) {
            double xi = 0.5 * (x0 + N / x0);
            if (Math.abs(x0 - xi) < 1e-7) {
                break;
            }
            x0 = xi;
        }

        return (int) x0;
    }
```

***Analysis***

**Time Complexity**: `O(logx)`.
**Space Complexity**: `O(1)`.
