***By Frank Luo***

We know how to find `2.0` raised to the power `10`. The easiest way is to multiply `10` times `2.0` by loop, but what if we have to find `2.0` raised to the power very large number such as `10000` or more?

We will discuss how to find the solution of such problems by using an fast, efficient algorithm.

# Brute Force

We multiply `a` to itself `b` times. That is, `a^b = a * a * a * ... * a (b occurrences of a)`. A simple java implementation of that would be:

```java
    public static double myPow(double x, int n) {
        if (n == 0 || x == 1) {
            return 1;
        } else if (x == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        double ans = x;
        boolean isNegative = false;
        long nLong = n;
        if (nLong < 0) {
            nLong = -nLong;
            isNegative = true;
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < nLong; i++) {
            ans = ans * x;
        }

        if (isNegative) {
            ans = 1 / ans;
        }

        return ans;
    }
```

## Analysis

**Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
**Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

# Exponentiation by Squaring

Exponentiation by Squaring can help us in finding the powers of large positive integers. The key is to the **divide the power in half** at each step.

The following recursive approach expresses the same idea:

Let‚Äôs take an example:

```txt
3 ^ 10 = 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3
// Try to divide the power by 2
3 ^ 10 = (3 * 3) * (3 * 3) * (3 * 3) * (3 * 3) * (3 * 3)
3 ^ 10 = ((3 * 3) ^ 5)
3 ^ 10 = 9 ^ 5
```

Effectively, power is divided by `2` and base is multiplied to itself. So we can write `3^10 = 9^5`.

Now, our problem is to find `9^5`.

```txt
9 ^ 5 = 9 * 9 * 9 * 9 * 9
// Try to divide the power by 2
// Since the power is an odd number here, we cannot do so.
// However there's another way to represent 9 ^ 5
9 ^ 5 = (9 ^ 4) * 9
// Now we can find 9 ^ 4 and later multiple the extra 9 to the result
9 ^ 5 = (81 ^ 2) * 9
```

Effectively, when power is not divisible by `2`, we make power even by taking out the extra `9`. Then we already know the solution when power is divisible by `2`. Divide the power by `2` and multiply the base to itself.

Now our problem is to find `(81^2)*9`

```txt
(81 ^ 2) * 9 = (81 * 81) * 9
// Try to divide the power by 2
(81 ^ 2) * 9 = (6561 ^ 1) * 9
```

Finally, we have our solution `3^10 = (6561^1)*9 = 6561*9 = 59049`

Let‚Äôs use **recusive** in java.

```java
    public static double myPow_quick(double x, int n) {
		long N = n;
		if (n > 0) {
            return quickMul(x, N);
        } else {
            return 1.0 / quickMul(x, -N);
        }
    }

    public static double quickMul(double x, long n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return 1.0;
        }

        double y = quickMul(x, n / 2);
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            return y * y;
        } else {
            return y * y * x;
        }
    }
```

## Analysis

**Time Complexity**: `O(logn)`
**Space Complexity**: `O(logn)`

# Iterative

Although the complexity of both approaches is identical, but if we use **iteration** instead of **recursion** will be faster in practice since we don't have the overhead of the recursive calls and reduce the space.

```java
    public static double myPow_3(double x, int n) {
        long N = n;
        return N >= 0 ? binaryPower(x, N) : 1.0 / binaryPower(x, -N);
    }

    public static double binaryPower(double a, long b) {
		double res = 1.0;
		while (b > 0) {
			if ((b & 1) == 1) {
				res = res * a;
			}
			a = a * a;
			b >>= 1;
		}
		
		return res;
	}
```

## Analysis

**Time Complexity**: `O(logn)`
**Space Complexity**: `O(logn)`
