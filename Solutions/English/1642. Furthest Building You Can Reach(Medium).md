# Intuition

While we are moving, we will need to use bricks or ladders several times. Suppose we have to move to the next building, which means we must use **one** ladder or `Δh` bricks, so there is a question, whether to use ladders or bricks?

If the gap of buildings is large, we may use the ladder, otherwise we use the bricks.

We can consider **ladder** as a one-time unlimited number of bricks, That is, if we have l ladders, we will use the ladder on the `l` times where `Δh` is the largest, and use the bricks in the rest.
 
Therefore, we got the answer. We maintain no more than `l` largest `Δh` using priority queues, and these are where the ladders are used. For the remaining `Δh`, we need to use bricks, so we need to accumulate them, if the `sum` exceeds the number of bricks `b`, then we have move to the furthest building.

The code is as follows:

```java
    public int furthestBuilding(int[] heights, int bricks, int ladders) {
        int len = heights.length;

        PriorityQueue<Integer> gaps = new PriorityQueue<>((o1, o2) -> o1 - o2);

        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < len - 1; i++) {
            int deltaHeight = heights[i + 1] - heights[i];
            if (deltaHeight > 0) {
                gaps.offer(deltaHeight);
                if (gaps.size() > ladders) {
                    sum += gaps.poll();
                }

                if (sum > bricks) {
                    return i;
                }
            }
        }

        return len - 1;
    }
```

## Analysis

**Time Complexity**: `O(nlogl)`
**Space Complexity**: `O(l)`
