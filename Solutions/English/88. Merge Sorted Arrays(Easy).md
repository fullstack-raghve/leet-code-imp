[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) [88. Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/).

# Two Pointers

Since the extra space of `nums1` is in the **back**, it's better to process the sorted data from the back to the front, fill in the values while traversing the array.

Let two pointers `len1` and `len2` to point to the tails of `nums1` and `nums2`, traversal from the tail and compare the values, and set the pointer `len` to point to the end of `nums1`. After each traversal of the size of the comparison value, it will be filled.

When `len1 < 0`, the traversal ends. If the data of `nums2` is not copied completely, we can copy the rest to the front of `nums1`, and finally we got the answer. 

The process is show as the following images.

```java
class Solution {
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        int len1 = m - 1;
        int len2 = n - 1;
		
        int len = m + n - 1;
		
        while(len1 >= 0 && len2 >= 0) {
            nums1[len--] = nums1[len1] > nums2[len2] ? nums1[len1--] : nums2[len2--];
        }
		
        System.arraycopy(nums2, 0, nums1, 0, len2 + 1);
    }
}
```

## Analysis

**Time Complexity**: `O(m+n)`
**Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
