[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)[895. Maximum Frequency Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-frequency-stack).

***By Frank Luo***

First, let's look at the problem description:

>FreqStack() constructs an empty frequency stack.
>1. void push(int val) pushes an integer val onto the top of the stack.
>2. int pop() removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.
>3. If there is a tie for the most frequent element, the element closest to the stack's top is removed and returned.

The requirements of the problems can be listed in **3** rules:

1.  Pop the stack by the **max** frequency;
2. Among all the elements  with the same (maximum) frequency,  pop the element **closest to the stack's top**.

To simplify the problem, let's just ignore **rule 2** for now, it looks easier.

# Step 1
We care more about the **frequency** of the elements. Let freq be a **Map** of occurrences of xx to xx. 

Additionally, we also care about **maxfreq**, the current maximum frequency of any element in the stack. we use `maxFreq` to store the maximum frequency.

Code:

```java
    class FreqStack_map {
        Map<Integer, Integer> freqMap;
        int maxFreq = 0;

        public FreqStack_map() {
            freqMap = new HashMap<>();
            maxFreq = 0;
        }

        public void push(int val) {
            int freq = freqMap.getOrDefault(val, 0) + 1;
            freqMap.put(val, freq);
            if (freq > maxFreq) {
                maxFreq = freq;
            }
        }

        public int pop() {
            int ret = freqMap.get(maxFreq);
            freqMap.put(ret, freqMap.get(ret) - 1);
            maxFreq--;
            return ret;
        }
    }
```

This solution has a problem. If elements with the same frequency, how to judge which element is the newest? 

# Step 2

How to know the order of elements with the same frequency? 

We can use the **stack** to query this information: elements near the top of the stack are always newer.

We consider the elements with the same frequency are **groups**. In a group, elements were stored in the stack. 

Using HashMap combined with LinkedList, the time complexity of inserting and deleting is `O(1)`.

```java
class FreqStack {
    Map<Integer, Integer> freqMap;
    Map<Integer, LinkedList<Integer>> groupFreqMap;
    int maxFreq = 0;

    public FreqStack() {
        freqMap = new HashMap<>();
        groupFreqMap = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public void push(int val) {
        int freq = freqMap.getOrDefault(val, 0) + 1;
        freqMap.put(val, freq);
        if (freq > maxFreq) {
            maxFreq = freq;
        }

        groupFreqMap.putIfAbsent(freq, new LinkedList<>());
        groupFreqMap.get(freq).push(val);
    }

    public int pop() {
        int res = groupFreqMap.get(maxFreq).pop();
        freqMap.put(res, freqMap.get(res) - 1);
        if (groupFreqMap.get(maxFreq).isEmpty()) {
            groupFreqMap.remove(maxFreq);
            maxFreq--;
        }

        return res;
    }
}

/**
 * Your FreqStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * FreqStack obj = new FreqStack();
 * obj.push(val);
 * int param_2 = obj.pop();
 */
```

## Analysis

**Time Complexity**: `O(1)`, for `push` and `pop`.
**Space Complexity**: `O(n)`.
