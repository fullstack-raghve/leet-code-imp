# Greedy

As we want to minimize the **lexicographical** order of the constructed string, let's start from the **beginning** of the string, select the **smallest** letter that satisfies the requirements each time,  then we get the final answer.

Suppose we are currently constructed to a certain position, as the picture below shows.

![Greedy](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/95d7fbe8-01ec-4594-a79a-d773da5b1bcc_1647914018.2457857.png)

Including this position, there are still `n_rest` left to fill in, the remaining sum of these rest positions is `k_rest`.
 
If we put a letter ch, and so the remaining `n_rest - 1` positions with the sum is `k_rest` must satisfy:

`1 * (n_rest − 1) ≤ k_rest − ch ≤ 26 * (n_rest − 1)`

can be:

`k_rest − 26 * (n_rest − 1) ≤ ch ≤ k_rest − 1 * (n_rest − 1)`

So `ch` 

1. `k_rest − 26 * (n_rest − 1) <= 0`, we choose the character `a`;

2. `k_rest − 26 * (n_rest − 1) > 0`, we choose the character corresponding to this value.
 
Let's write the code:
 
```java
    public String getSmallestString_greedy(int n, int k) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(n);
        for (int rest = n; rest >= 1; rest--) {
            int bound = k - 26 * (rest - 1);
            if (bound > 0) {
                char ch = (char) (bound + 'a' - 1);
                sb.append(ch);
                k -= bound;
            } else {
                sb.append('a');
                k--;
            }
        }

        return sb.toString();
    }
```
 
## Analysis

**Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
**Space Complexity**: `O(n)`
