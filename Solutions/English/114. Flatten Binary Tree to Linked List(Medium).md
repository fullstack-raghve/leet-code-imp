[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) [114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list).

***By Frank Luo***

The Binary Tree Traversal Algorithms can be find here [Tree Traversals All In One: PreOrder, InOrder and PostOrder](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/discuss/1860290/tree-traversals-preorder-inorder-and-postorder-algorithms-all-in-one).

We can use `DFS` to traversal the binary tree.

To **Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List**, there are `3` steps as the picture shows.

![DFS](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/3dcbb9c1-5c2d-4d9c-930b-bbccf3f7bbe2_1648283800.2439668.png)

1. Flatten the left subtree of the root node into a linked list;
2. Flatten the right subtree of the root node into a linked list;
3. Let the right subtree of the step 2 be the **right child** of **the farest right node** of the left subtree of step 1.

Obiously, that's a **recursive** process.

Let's coding it.

```java
    public static void flatten_rec(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return;
        }

		// left subtree
        flatten_rec(root.left);
		// right subtree
        flatten_rec(root.right);

        TreeNode temp = root.right;
        root.right = root.left;
        root.left = null;

        // find the farest right node.
        while (root.right != null) {
            root = root.right;
        }

        root.right = temp;
    }
```

## Analysis

**Time Complexity**: `O(n)`.
**Space Complexity**: `O(n)`.
