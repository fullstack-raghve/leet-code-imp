***By Frank Luo***

Each round we **exclusive** a half to reduce the scale of this problem.

```java
public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return left;  
    }
```
