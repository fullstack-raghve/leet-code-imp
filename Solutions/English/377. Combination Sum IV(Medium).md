[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) [377. Combination Sum IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iv/).

Here shows **2** Approaches to slove this problem: Backtrack and Dynamic Programming.

# Backtrack

TLE

```java
class Solution {
    int total = 0;
    
    public int combinationSum4(int[] nums, int target) {
        total = 0;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        backtrack(nums, target);
        return total;
    }

    private void backtrack(int[] nums, int remain) {
        if (remain == 0) {
            total++;
            return;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > remain) {
                break;
            }

            backtrack(nums, remain - nums[i]);
        }
    }
}
```

## Analysis

**Time Complexity**: `O(n^Sum(target))`
**Space Complexity**: `O(target)`

# Dynamic Programming

```java
    public int combinationSum4(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] dp = new int[target + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= target; i++) {
            for (int x : nums) {
                if (x > i) {
                    continue;
                }

                dp[i] += dp[i - x];
            }
        }

        return dp[target];
    }
```

## Analysis

**Time Complexity**: `O(target * n)`
**Space Complexity**: `O(target)`

# Follow Up

If the given array contains **negative** numbers, it will result in an infinite-length permutation.

For example, if the array `nums` contains positive integers `A` and negative integers `B` (where `A>0`, `B<0`), so there is `A*B + (-B)*A=0`. Which means for any permutation whose sum of elements is equal to `target`, we can add `target + A*B + (-B)*A=target`.

Therefore, as long as there is an arrangement whose sum of elements is equal to `target`, an arrangement of infinite length can be constructed.

If negative numbers are allowed, the maximum length of permutations must be limited to avoid infinite-length permutations before the number of permutations can be counted.
