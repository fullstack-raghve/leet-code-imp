[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) [1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-remove-to-make-valid-parentheses/).

***By Frank Luo***

# EXPLANATION

First we can use `brute force`  ideas to into a `two-step` algorithm:

1. find all the `(` and `)`  and get their indices;
2. determine the indices that need to be **deleted**;
3. creates a new string from the index of the deleted characters.

We use a stack to store the indices of all `(` and `)` s. When scanning to the end of the string, all indices remaining in the stack are `(` and `)` s that do not match. 

We also need to use a collection to keep track of unmatched `(` and `)` s. Then Delete each character that needs to be deleted according to the indices, returning the recreated string.

## CODE

***Java:***

```java
    public String minRemoveToMakeValid(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() <= 0) {
            return s;
        }

        int len = s.length();
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(len);
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        Set<Integer> idx = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);
            if (ch == '(') {
                stack.push(i);
                idx.add(i);
            } else if (ch == ')') {
                if (!stack.empty()) {
                    idx.remove(stack.pop());
                } else {
                    idx.add(i);
                }
            }
        }

        while (!stack.empty()) {
            idx.add(stack.pop());
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (!idx.contains(i)) {
                sb.append(s.charAt(i));
            }
        }

        return sb.toString();
    }
```

## Analysis

**Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
**Space Complexity**: `O(n)`
